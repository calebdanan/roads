HOW TO EDIT

There's a lot to edit on each level.
1. Each level must have a level(ie level: 1, 2, etc)
    - level number in main.js counts the "total active weapons."
    - add level name to main.js
    - some levels may have different delays. This is both in firing delay and correlating animation.
2. Weapons
    - Weapons rotate up and down, so they will be shown twice.
3. Shifting from scroll to top-down
    - different "MyGame" screen. Can't go directly from dorm 1 -> pong
    - edit "levelexit" to change direction to game mode


dorm 1 > dorm 4 > exit level > mygame2 > pong > pong2
